# Project 1 – Suicide Rate Analysis in the United States

This project explores historical suicide trends across various demographics in the U.S. using structured data analysis and visualization techniques. Conducted as part of the Computation and Visualization (IE6600) course, this study aims to uncover actionable insights for public health and mental health policy.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze suicide rates by **age**, **gender**, and **race/ethnicity**
- Identify long-term **temporal trends** (1950–2020)
- Understand **demographic disparities**
- Provide data-driven recommendations for **prevention strategies**

## 🗂️ Dataset

**Title:** Death rates for suicide by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age – United States  
**Source:** [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-hispanic-origin-and-age-united-states-020c1)  
**Records:** 6,390 (1950–2020)

The dataset includes:
- Suicide rate per 100,000 population
- Age group, gender, race/ethnicity
- Yearly records and flags for interpretative caution

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Dropped redundant and duplicate columns
- Renamed variables for clarity
- Handled missing values by removing incomplete rows

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Trends over time:** Suicide rates declined until 2000s, then increased
- **Age analysis:** Elderly (85+) had the highest rates
- **Gender:** Males represent nearly 80% of suicides
- **Race/Ethnicity:** White and American Indian males had the highest rates

### 3. Correlation & Visualization
- Created line plots, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps
- Weak correlation found between year and suicide rate, indicating non-linear influence of external factors

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Demographics Matter:** Age, gender, and race significantly influence suicide trends
- **Elderly & Male Vulnerability:** These groups are at highest risk
- **Recent Rise:** Since 2010, suicide rates have trended upward again
- **Policy Implication:** Need for gender-specific and elderly-focused interventions
